       "[\"Me and my Father's go to Italian restaurant in the city.Don't know where to start... I've had it all from the chicken parm to lasagna to ravioli and I've NEVER been disappointed.Food is A+, service is A++During the Summer the restaurant is packed most nights, especially on the weekends. Italians visiting from Italy are always eating here - Which is a very good sign. Nice on-street outdoor seating if you're lucky enough to score a table.Also the Caprese is a must for appetizer, especially if you love fresh mozzarella (who doesn't)\",\n",
       " \"We came to Little Italy for a late dinner, knowing there would be a bit of a selection process, especially as we had a group of six. Our group settled on Da Gennaro, and we were seated in their second storefront (a small room to the right, beyond a building/apartment entrance). It was a bit cold and a bit loud (from the music), but still had a nice ambience.The menu was appealing overall, though unfortunately none of the specials and none of the drinks had prices listed. The person who sat us was friendly and ultimately ensured we had everything we would like, especially when we hadn't received any bread for quite a while after we sat down.The dishes were quite tasty (I had lobster ravioli), as was the red sangria. During our meal, we were approached by a photographer and someone selling flowers (we declined both). Unfortunately, as we were wrapping up our meal, we observed a mouse scurrying around the other side of the room, about 10 feet away from some of our party. Not the best ending to an otherwise pretty good meal.Based on the ambience, prices, and cleanliness, I would probably choose a different restaurant for dinner if I ever return to Little Italy.\",\n",
       " 'The place and workers were pleasant. I was disappointed after all with the fetuccinne Alfredo. As an Italian food connoisseur, I feel cheated when I order Alfredo sauce and what I get is whipped cream in its original version (just cream!)with some extra butter and salt. When I go to an Italian restaurant, I want my Alfredo prepared with Parmigiano-Reggiano. Also, the pasta was hard. 1 more minute boiling and it would have been al dente. My husbands meal was pretty good. I ended up sharing his dish.',\n",
       " 'Really cute Italian restaurant in the heart of Little Italy. And definitely one of the best in the area. Came here in the evening during the summer and opted for the outdoor seating and the ambience is just lovely. I ordered the Spaghetti Alla Carbonara and it was one of the best spaghetti I ever had and it was very flavorful. It comes with onions and prosciutto in cream sauce. For drinks, I got the Espresso Martini and the White Chocolate Old Fashion, and they are both spot on. Great service! Great food! Highly recommended. Will definitely be back to try other dishes.',\n",
       " \"A group of friends and I found a table amidst the crowds at the Feast of San Gennaro this past weekend. \\xa0Centrally located in the remnants of Little Italy in Manhattan, Da Gennaro offered a safe, conservative Italian menu that will surely satisfy unadventurous eaters looking for the comfort of a standard red sauce. \\xa0Finding the host in the crowds was a bit difficult, and after we were picked up by one host, another swooped in to take us to another table. \\xa0I attribute this to the crowded and busy nature of the festival, but needless to say, it was difficult to find the host's stand without some looking. \\xa0We were seated at a table outside, which allowed us to watch the festival passers-by and activities on the street. \\xa0The service was prompt and attentive, but clearly designed to be quick; there was no explanation of the menu, no daily specials, no menu highlights. \\xa0We did promptly receive some water and our drink orders were taken. \\xa0As I suspected with most of the cocktails based around aperitifs, the Da Gennaro Spritzer I ordered, which was mixed with Aperol and prosecco, was almost sickly sweet, with the medicinal Aperol flavor overpowering any other element of the drink. \\xa0Definitely would not recommend for anyone other than the most fervent Aperol fans. \\xa0The follow up glass of house Chianti was much better, leading me to believe wines are safer than cocktails at Da Gennaro. \\xa0The bread brought to the table was quite good, with the star being the olive oil, which was mixed with herbs and had some degree of spice. \\xa0It was a welcome departure from the cheap, obligatory olive oil and bread served at other establishments. \\xa0I ordered the rigatoni alla vodka, which was satisfactory, though priced quite high for what it is. \\xa0There was nothing notable about the dish, which isn't to say it was bad, but rather middle of the road. \\xa0It evoked the familiar spicy, creaminess of a vodka sauce but wasn't anything you couldn't find at a comparable restaurant. And of course, you're offered fresh grated Parmesan once served. \\xa0I left feeling as if this was a safe spot to bring someone from out of town who might not be ready to indulge in more adventurous eating, or who valued eating in Little Italy more than eating the best Italian food. \\xa0To truly standout, Da Gennaro would need to focus on its service to really highlight the fun/delicious parts of the menu, or develop a niche that sets it apart from competitors (such as the well-herbed olive oil). \\xa0Right now, it seems its location, aimed more at tourists than natives, may be valued higher than the food.\",\n",
       " 'The place is pretty cool. I came here during the Feast of San Gennaro. It wasn\\'t too busy, but they definitely packed the place - to the point where I couldn\\'t move without bumping into the person behind me (annoying). \\xa0Our second server was nice, however, the first server that we had kept correcting my party if something was not pronounced correctly in Italian. At first it was cute, but got annoying pretty quickly. Menu Recommendations:-Spaghetti & Meatballs-RAVIOLI \"BELLA NAPOLI\"Future Recommendations:-Don\\'t overpack the restaurant -Warm bread would be amazing',\n",
       " \"Came here while I visited NYC- overall great experience. Service is a bit slow but it's a small place that feels very homey. Got the INSALATA CAPRESE which was tasty. Also got their RAVIOLI which was pretty good. Def. recommend this gem.\",\n",
       " 'Nice authentic italain spot in the heart of little Italy. My wife and i stopped here during the feast of sangenaro and had a nice time. The restaurant was packed however the service was fast and friendly. We got the chicken parm and spaghetti to split and a glass of red sangria. Both were great. The sauce on the chicken parm and spaghetti was awesome! Id definitely recommend coming here whether for dinner or just a quick glass of wine and an app.',\n",
       " \"A little piece of Italy in NY. Our host and waiter were very friendly (too bad I didn't get their names). Now the food.... OMG it was incredible, very tasteful. Very attentive staff. I totally recommend this place if you want to have a piece of Italy. In other words... You would love this place!\",\n",
       " \"Went for a girls night out and I have to say I was not impressed at all. Extremely over priced for pasta with the meat as a side a la carte. I tried the lobster ravioli a total of 6 pieces. Between everyone's food and appetizers I still left hungry and had to get dessert elsewhere. I have to say the oil for the bread is amazing though and we did keep asking for more.\",\n",
       " \"Great service. The ambiance is quaint and lovely. \\xa0It was a wonderful place for my daughter's birthday celebration!\",\n",
       " 'Had a wonderful time with my niece for her 18th birthday! Staff was wonderful, and the food is DiLisio so! Be sure to say hi to Andre at the door!! ;D',\n",
       " \"Stopped in for lunch while exploring Little Italy. Best lasagna I've ever had. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a fun gem for a meal!\",\n",

       " 'Really great Italian place in Little Italy! The pasta is delicious, and they have good prices for lunch. Recommended the spaghetti bolognese and lobster ravioli, and I also tried the sangria which was very good.',\n",
       " \"Everything you'd want in a Little Italy experience. Cute greeter girl literally pulling people off the street to go in and eat. Italian music and a fun mix of locals and tourists. Possible the best spaghetti and meet balls I've ever had. I stole a bite of my wife's lasagna and it was incredible too. They really pack the people in there but it's part of the charm. We wanted as close to an authentic Italian experience as we could get and we found it. We'll for sure be back.\",\n",
       " 'Stopped in for lunch today. Fabulous food fabulous customer service. They were very accommodating and made us feel right at home. We definitely will be back ! \\xa0A really nice dining experience all around. From San Francisco with love xo',\n",
       " 'This has been our go to spot in Little Italy for many many years. Food is consistently good. Drinks are good and the people watching if you sit outside is amazing too :)I usually have the risotto Milanese which is perfect for hot or cold weather and is quite light for a risotto. Hubby usually opts for the spaghetti meatballs or bolognese, either way he always hmmmms and ahhhs through his whole meal. \\xa0The bread that comes before meal with some herb oil for dipping is always fresh. We occasionally opt for the tiramisu for desert but are usually too stuffed after mains for anything more.',\n",
       " 'I really wanted to like this. I thought \\'this is going to be the place in Little Italy that I finally love\". It\\'s on the corner, in the heart of Little Italy, with excessive outdoor seating, great ambiance inside, it has that \\'authentic\\' Italian feel. It seems easy to get a seat most times, but is always busy wether at brunch, lunch or dinner. The service was actually very good, quick, fast, helpful. I wanted gnocchi, and asked the waiter which one was better, and was recommended to get the Alla Sorrentina. I was very disappointed with pretty much everything about the meal. The gnocchi was sticky, hard, not flavorful. The sauce seemed reheated, lacked flavor, didn\\'t have enough sauce. The mozzerrella didn\\'t melt and was just not good. I question if I ordered the wrong thing, but given this was a popular dish, and recommended by the waiter, I think it\\'s just that this place is just average when compared to all the other pasta possibilities in NYC.',\n",
       " \"Located in Little Italy this place is a quaint hole in the wall with fresh and delicious pasta.Honestly we stumbled upon this place because it started raining so I jumped on yelp and found the closest restaurant with the best reviews and Bam there was Da Gennaros! To start out there was a party of 7 of us which wasn't a problem for them because we were seated right away at a small table by the front. The wait staff was friendly, accommodating, and knowledgeable about the menu.To start out my best friend and I shared a bottle Prosecco $38 and the meatball appetizer. The meatballs. were fresh and delicious especially with that cream on top. I ordered the egg plant Parmesan with angel hair instead of linguine noodles it was pretty good with a good amount of cheese on top no complaints. Next time tho I'll just try something else, because some of the dishes the people at my table that looks absolutely delicious.\"]"
